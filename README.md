# Simulator for radio controlled cars
This project is a simulator for radio controlled cars developed using Java.

## Getting Started
The simulator test various commands and see if the radio controlled cars can execute them without hitting the wall. The simulator is a console application.

The commands that the simulator accept is forward, back, left and right. Forward make the car move forward 1 meter, back make the car move backwards 1 meter, left rotate the car 90° counterclockwise and right rotate the car 90° clockwise.

The simulated environment is a room. The room size is in whole meters (no decimals). The simulated car is treated as a round object with 1 meter in diameter.

The image below shows all possible positions in a 4 meters wide and 4 meters long room, the highlighted coordinate [0,0] is the most southwest point in which the car will fit.
